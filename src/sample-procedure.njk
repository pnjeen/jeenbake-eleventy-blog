    This guide provides step-by-step procedures for using the Participant Dashboard in Jeenbake’s Sales Commission system. 
    A <strong>Participant</strong> can be either a <strong>sales representative</strong> or a <strong>manager</strong>, 
    each assigned one or more <strong>Positions</strong> that determine their role within the compensation program.
  </p>

  <p>
    The dashboard interface and available features differ based on the participant's role:
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Sales Representatives</strong> can view their individual earnings, performance metrics, and related documents.</li>
      <li><strong>Managers</strong> can view both their own data and dashboards of their subordinate participants.</li>
    </ul>
  </p>

  <p>
    This page covers procedures for viewing dashboards, accessing messages and reports, accepting documents, raising disputes, and managing account settings.

  <h2>Accessing the Dashboard</h2>
  <p>
    Participants in the Jeenbake Sales Commission system—whether Sales Representatives or Managers—access dashboards tailored to their role. 
    The type of dashboard view available depends on the participant's assigned position. 
    This section outlines both the available dashboard views and the step-by-step process to access them.
  </p>

  <h3>Dashboard Views</h3>
  <p>
    In the dashboard, there are two types of views based on the participant's role. Sales representatives typically have one view, 
    while managers have access to multiple dashboard options.
  </p>

<div class="table-responsive">
  <table class="styled-table">
    <thead>
      <tr>
        <th>View Name</th>
        <th>Description</th>
        <th>Applies To</th>
      </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
      <tr>
        <td>DASH_DG_SDM</td>
        <td>This view is for Participants.</td>
        <td>Sales Development Manager (SDM)</td>
      </tr>
