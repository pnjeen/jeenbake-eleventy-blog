## Lets have heading 2 here
We’ve designed dozens of websites for clients across industries—from retail to IT.

Here’s the simple process we follow:

### Step 1: Understand the Goals

We talk with stakeholders to identify what the site must *do*—not just what it must *look* like.

### Step 2: Map Out the Content

We write and organize content to guide visitors toward actions (buying, contacting, signing up, etc.).

### Step 3: Design and Develop

We turn structure into clean, responsive designs using HTML/CSS/JS, WordPress, or static site generators like Eleventy.

### Step 4: Test and Launch

Final QA, SEO checks, and deployment.
